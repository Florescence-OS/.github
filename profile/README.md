1. First clone kernel repository.
```git
git clone https://github.com/Florescence-OS/kernel.git
```
2. Then generate configuration, our test is on Ubuntu 22.04. We have put our test configuration in arch/x86/configs/, so you can easily use make to copy our configuration.
```make
make ubuntu_config
```

```make
make && make install
```
